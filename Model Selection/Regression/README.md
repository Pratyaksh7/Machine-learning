# Model Selection 

The common dataset is applied to all the Regression models namely:
1. Multiple Linear Regression
2. Polynomial Regression
3. Support Vector Regression
4. Decision Tree Regression
5. Random Forest Regression

Then using the  "r2_score" class from "sklearn.metrics" module to find the actual accuracy in order to select the best model among the all listed above for this particular Dataset.

### Accuracy Results came to be as follows:
1. Multiple Linear Regression Accuracy : 0.9325315554761303
2. Polynomial Regression Accuracy : 0.9458193390165572
3. Support Vector Regression Accuracy : 0.9480784049986258
4. Decision Tree Regression Accuracy :  0.9226091050550043
5. Random Forest Regression Accuracy :  0.9615980699813017

So, as a result for the particular dataset Random Forest Regression came to be the best model.
