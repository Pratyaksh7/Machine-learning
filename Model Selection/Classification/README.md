# Model Selection 

The common dataset is applied to all the Regression models namely:
1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbors
3. Support Vector Machine
4. Kernal SVM
5. Naive Bayes
6. Decision Tree Classification
7. Random Forest Classification

Then using the  "accuracy_score" class from "sklearn.metrics" module to find the actual accuracy in order to select the best model among the all listed above for this particular Dataset.

### Accuracy Results came to be as follows:
1. Logistic Regression : 0.9473684210526315
2. K-Nearest Neighbors : 0.9473684210526315
3. Support Vector Machine : 0.9415204678362573
4. Kernel SVM : 0.9532163742690059
5. Naive Bayes : 0.9415204678362573
6. Decision Tree Classification : 0.9590643274853801
7. Random Forest Classification : 0.935672514619883

So, as a result for the particular dataset Decision Tree Classification came to be the best model.
